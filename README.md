# ask-me-anything

## Description

This is a website similar to Crowd Sourced, Reddit/Quora Style Message Board for Senior Developers & Tech Pros

The goal was to create a question and answer message board, similar to Reddit, Quora, StackOverflow or other such sites. Users should be able to submit a question, then other users can respond with answers.

The message board allows junior developers and newbies learning to code to ask questions that senior developers, product owners, senior designers, recruiters, and other tech professionals can answer.

You're welcome to further refine the audience your specific message board serves, too. (For example, your message board's community could focus on: Students who have less than a year experience, tech pros who are people of color, LGBTQ, rural coders, Portland or Seattle area only, students over the age of 40, those learning specific languages or technologies, etc.)
